# Welcome
Hello, I'm Sage, I'm a 19yo programmer from Ohio.
You can contact me through discord at `sage4424` or, if you prefer, email at sage.codes@email.com.
My main languages are `C`, `Python`, and `Assembler`, but I also quite enjoy esoterics like `Whitespace`, `Brainf*ck`, `LOLCODE`, and `Befunge`.

### Personal Opinion-based Statements
* Programming Paradigms Opinions
  * I am impartial to OOP Programming
  * Functional Programming has its place, but its definately overhyped
  * Procedural Programming rules superior
* C vs C++
  * C lets you shoot yourself in the foot, C++ blows the whole foot off
  * I hate C++ Templates with a passion, void* based solutions are superior
  * Benefits of C++, supports OOP, Classes, Greater library support
  * Benefits of C, wider system compatibility, puts greater emphasis towards understanding high-level datatypes, *verry* minutely faster, smaller executable size, less abstractions, simple and easy to learn.
* Other Things
  * Programmer Socks <3
  * Stack-based languages rule
  * I collect vintage 80's computers
 
### Other Things
I am currently trying to get used to working with Git and overall Version Control, as I haven't consistantly used them in the past, but would like to get a better understanding of them. 

Currently I'm working on writing my Whitespace Interpreter. After the current project is in a stable state, I'm hoping to start writing a Library of generic functions and (void* based) datatypes for my C projects. Datatypes that I would like to implement include: Hashmap, LinkedList, and a GenericType;
